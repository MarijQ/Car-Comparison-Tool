## Introduction

In this project, we aimed to collect and analyse car listings from three websites: Carwow, Lookers, and Cargiant. Our objective was to build a database capturing key details such as model, make, engine size, and price and provide a reliable average price for the used car market in the UK, useful for both buyers and sellers. We used various technologies to scrape and process the data. Ultimately, we developed an application that allows users to input their car preferences and retrieve the average price from our database.

---

## Project Overview

We utilise a combination of web scraping technologies and database management tools to extract and process data from targeted websites. Our workflow moves from data acquisition through scraping to data storage and user interaction via a custom application.

### Websites Scraped

-  **Carwow** : https://www.carwow.co.uk/used-cars
-  **Lookers** : https://www.lookers.co.uk/used-cars
-  **Cargiant** : https://www.cargiant.co.uk/search/

Each website offers a unique set of data related to used car listings, including details like model, price, engine size, hp, mpg etc.

### Tech Stack

- **Scrapy**:  Orchestrated the web scraping process, data processing and data storage.
- **Selenium**: Helped us interact with dynamic content on the websites.
- **Splash**:  Allowed us to render pages with JavaScript content in a headless browser before scraping.
- **PostgreSQL**:  Used to store and process the scraped data.
- **Python**:  Used to write the scraping scripts, data processing, and dashboard logic.
- **Tkinter**: Utilised to build an application that demonstrates user's interaction with the database

## Scraping and Data Collection
We developed three spiders, each tailored to efficiently scrape data from each website:

**Spiders**
- lookers.py:

  - Tools Used: Utilizes Scrapy for scraping the bulk of car features directly from AJAX API calls, which return data in JSON format.
  - Additional Rendering: Uses Splash to render JavaScript content on the website, enabling the scraping of additional feature lists of cars that are dynamically loaded.

- cargiant.py and carwow.py:

  - Tools Used: Employs Scrapy in conjunction with Selenium. This combination is crucial for handling the complex JavaScript and HTML structures found on these websites, which Splash alone could not adequately process.
  
**Data Standardisation**
- To facilitate the integration of scraped data into a unified database schema, we standardised the extraction of the following features across all three websites:

  -  Basic Car Information: Make, Model, Year, Price, Mileage
  -  Specifications: Fuel Type, Body Style, Engine Size, Horsepower (hp)
  -  Transmission Details: Type of Transmission
  -  Dealership Data: Name of the Dealership
  -  Efficiency and Capacity: Miles Per Gallon (mpg), Number of Doors
  -  Ownership History: Number of Previous Owners
  -  Additional Details: Droplet, List of Additional Features

## Data Storage and Preparation
The scraped data is processed and stored in a **PostgreSQL** database.

**Handling Missing Values**
- Any missing values in the dataset were retained as is for the current implementation. Future updates may address these through appropriate imputation techniques to ensure comprehensive data analysis
  
**Database Interaction with Psycopg2**
- We utilise the psycopg2 library to execute SQL-like queries directly from Python. When calculating the average price of cars, our queries are designed to consider only those car listings that fall within one standard deviation from the user-inputted value for each numeric attribute. For textual attributes, the matches must be exact.

---

## Average Price Generation
Calculation Methodology
- Only listings that meet these specified criteria are included in the calculations of the average price. Both the standard deviation and average price functions in psycopg2 inherently exclude rows with missing values in the relevant columns, ensuring that our statistics are computed based on complete and relevant data only.

---

## User Interface
**Use Case**: Comprehensive Feature Input 
- Users can specify all car features, whether they're aiming to buy and want to estimate a fair market price, or they're planning to sell and need to determine a competitive asking price based on detailed vehicle specifications
  - Screenshot: Displays a complete feature input (price excluded) for a comprehensive overview

Use Case: Partial Feature Input 
- Ideal for users who may not have complete details about a car they wish to buy or sell, our tool allows for flexible input, providing estimates even with incomplete feature sets.
  - Screenshot: Shows an example with partial feature input to demonstrate functionality with incomplete data
